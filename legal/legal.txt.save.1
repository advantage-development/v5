About Advantage Credits; General Restrictions: Advantage issues and redeems Advantage Credits. Advantage Credits may be used, kept, or exchanged online wherever parties are willing to accept Advantage Credits. Advantage Credits are fully backed by the Fiat used to purchase them at issuance. Advantage Credits are denominated in a range of Fiat. For example, if you purchase EURT, your Advantages Credits are fully backed by Euros. If you cause to be issued EURT 100.00, Advantage holds €100.00 to back those Advantage Credits. The range of Fiat available to denominate Advantage Credits is within the sole control and at the sole and absolute discretion of Advantage. Advantage Credits are backed by money, but they are not money themselves. Advantage will not issue Advantage Credits for consideration that is other Digital Credits (for example, bitcoin), and will not redeem Advantage Credits for other Digital Credits; only money will be accepted upon issuance, and only money will be provided upon redemption. In order to cause Advantage Credits to be issued or redeemed directly by Advantage, you must be a verified customer of Advantage. No exceptions will be made to this provision. The right to have Advantage Credits redeemed or issued is a contractual right personal to you.

Exceptions to this policy may be made by Advantage, in its sole discretion, for Eligible Contract Participants only, which shall be customers solely of TLTD. 

For the avoidance of doubt, as defined above, U.S. Persons (including but not limited to United States Citizens or United States Residents) are prohibited from using the Site or any Services. In addition, where you are not a U.S. Person and your account would not be regarded as a U.S. Account, but Advantage knows or has reason to know that you are making a deposit, withdrawal, or transfer of Fiat or Digital Credits to, from, or through any U.S. Financial Institution to facilitate the provision of the Services to you, then you may be regarded as a customer of TLTD and prohibited from using the Site or any Services, at the sole discretion of Advantage.

Trading markets in Digital Credits are volatile and shift quickly in terms of price, liquidity, market depth, and trading dynamics.

The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral decision may be enforced in court. For claims less than $15,000, TLTD shall reimburse you for all initiating filing fees that are in excess of fees you would have paid if you were proceeding in court, provided however, should you be deemed to be the losing Party, the filing fees reimbursed by TLTD shall be added to the final arbitrator’s costs and fees award. The prevailing Party shall be entitled to its costs of the arbitration (including the arbitrator’s fees) and its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. You and Advantage agree that any Party hereto may bring claims against the others only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. No class arbitration is permitted, and no arbitrator may consolidate or join more than one Person’s or Party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Any relief awarded to any one Advantage user cannot and may not affect any other Advantage users.
